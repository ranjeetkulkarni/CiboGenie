    python -m venv cibogenv
    source cibogenv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use cibogenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the environment variables for API keys:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your keys:
      ```env
      GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
      GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
      GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
      ```

5. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

6. **Open the local URL** (usually [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)) in your browser to start using CiboGenie.

## **Usage**

1. **Enter a Food Item:** Type a food item (e.g., "Coke") into the input field.
2. **Get Detailed Insights:** Receive a structured, actionable breakdown, including:
    - Ingredients List
    - Safe Consumption Guidelines
    - Healthier Substitutes
    - Comparison with Similar Products
    - Special Health Considerations
3. **Add Your Location:** Input your location (city or area) to find the nearest shops where you can purchase the food item.
4. **Explore Further:** Browse through recommendations for better alternatives and dietary tips.
